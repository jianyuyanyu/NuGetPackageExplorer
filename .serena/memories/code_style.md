C# projects target the .NET 10 preview SDK pinned in global.json (10.0.100-rc.2) with LangVersion=preview, nullable enabled, and AllowUnsafeBlocks. Follow .editorconfig: 4-space indent, UTF-8 BOM, PascalCase public APIs, interfaces prefixed with I, private fields _camelCase, prefer var and modern pattern matching. Keep new warning suppressions scoped narrowly and reuse existing MVVM + MEF patterns. Shared XAML lives under NugetPackageExplorer.Views.Shared.projitems and is reused by Uno targets.
